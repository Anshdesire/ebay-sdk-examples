# Trading Examples

These examples show how to use the eBay SDK for PHP with the Trading service.

1. [Get eBay Official Time](https://github.com/davidtsadler/ebay-sdk-examples/blob/master/trading/01-get-ebay-official-time.php)

   A basic example that retrieves the official eBay system time in GMT. This is a good way of testing your production eBay authorization tokens as the call does not modify any user data.
