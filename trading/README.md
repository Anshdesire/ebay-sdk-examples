# Trading Examples

These examples show how to use the eBay SDK for PHP with the Trading service.

1. [Get eBay Official Time](https://github.com/davidtsadler/ebay-sdk-examples/blob/master/trading/01-get-ebay-official-time.php)

   A basic example that retrieves the official eBay system time in GMT. This is a good way of testing your production eBay authorization tokens as the call does not modify any user data.

1. [Get Category Hierarchy](https://github.com/davidtsadler/ebay-sdk-examples/blob/master/trading/02-get-category-hierarchy.php)

   Shows how to retrieve the category hierarchy for a site. More information can be found in the [official eBay documentation](http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/guides/ebayfeatures/Development/Categories-Hierarchy.html).
